# Project 3 â€“ Semantic Analyzer

This project introduces a semantic analyzer that checks for meaning-related rules in the language.  
It verifies things like correct variable initialization, matching data types, and proper use of operators.  
The compiler reports semantic errors along with the line where they occur.
